Plant vs. Zombies â€“ C++ SFML Game
This is a Plant vs. Zombies-style tower defense game developed using C++, leveraging SFML for graphics and window management, and structured using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

ðŸ›  Features
ðŸŒ¿ Plants with unique abilities â€“ including shooters,repeaters and sun producers.
ðŸ§Ÿ Zombies with varying strengths and types â€“ that move across lanes and try to reach the house.
ðŸŽ® Smooth 2D graphics and animations powered by SFML.
ðŸ§± Grid-based planting system with interactive mouse input.
ðŸ§  Clean and modular code architecture using classes for Plants, Zombies, Projectiles, and Game Engine.
ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used
C++ â€“ for core logic and game loop.

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) â€“ for rendering graphics, handling events, and managing game windows.
OOP Concepts â€“ including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for scalable and maintainable code.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repo and compile using your preferred C++ environment with SFML installed. Ideal for learning:
Game development fundamentals
Real-world OOP in C++
Event-driven programming with SFML

ðŸŽ“ Note: This project was fully developed independently by me as part of a university assignment for my 2nd semester Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course.
